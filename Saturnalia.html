<h2>What is Saturnalia</h2>
<p style="color:white; font-size: 20px;">Saturnalia, the most popular holiday on the ancient Roman calendar, derived from older farming-related rituals of midwinter
    and the winter solstice, especially the practice of offering gifts or sacrifices to the gods during the winter sowing season.
    The pagan celebration of Saturn, the Roman god of agriculture and time, began as a single day, but by the late
    Republic (133-31 B.C.) it had expanded to a weeklong festival beginning December 17.
    (On the Julian calendar, which the Romans used at the time, the winter solstice fell on December 25.)</p>
<h2>How to Celebrate</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Wear the colors of the holiday. These are green and gold.</li>
    <li>Decorate over doorways, windows and even stairs with greenery.
        Garlands or wreaths are ideal. Add golden cutouts of the sun or golden pinecones, nuts, acorns.</li>
    <li>Hang cutouts of sun symbols, stars, and faces of the God Janus in living trees and bushes if you have them.</li>
    <li>Make cookies in the shape of suns, moons, stars, and herd animal shapes. Decorate them with green
        or gold frosting and/or sprinkles.</li>
    <li>If you can drink alcohol you can drink alcohol you can drink a mix of wine and honey called Mulsum.</li>
    <li>Greet people with the traditional cry of "Io, Saturnalia!" This is pronounced "yo sa-tur-NAL-ee-uh".</li>
    <li>host a feast with family and friends on December 17th.</li>
    <li>Give small presents, including presents of food or sweets, or candles or lamps.
        Attach a clever note or a short witty poem to your gifts.</li>
    <li>If you have a lararium(altar), make sure it is clean. Safely light a candle there.
        Display and decorate a statue of Saturnus, if you have one, or a photo of a statue or painting of him.</li>
    <li>Celebrate freedom and destroy hierarchies. Saturnalia was a type of opposite-day in which slaves could enjoy luxury alongside their masters.
        You may want to wear a pileus, a conical felt cap that in the classical world represented freedom.</li>

<p>Lupercalia was a very ancient, possibly pre-Roman pastoral annual festival, observed in the city of Rome on February 15, to avert evil spirits
    and purify the city, releasing health and fertility. Lupercalia was also called "dies Februatus",
    purified (literally "februated day") after the instruments of purification called "februa", which give the month of February (Februarius) its name.</p>
